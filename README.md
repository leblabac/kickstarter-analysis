# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Assignment: performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Crowdfunding Success
This project is to support up-and-coming playwrite Louise complete a crowdfunding campaign for her play, *Fever.* The play is estimated to cost $12,000. The object is to analyze data related to theater-related crowdfunding campaigns in order to identify trends and determine recommendations for optimal success.

## About the Data
A dataset of crowdfunding campaigns was successfully retrieved from www.acrowdsourcingwebsite.com containing data from a variety of crowdsourced fundraisers, including those supporting theater-related campaigns, which was the main source for the analysis. Twenty one (21) countries were represented within the data.

The dataset contained 4114 campaigns across 9 parent categories, with theater-related campaigns representing approximately 33% of the full dataset (1393 campaigns). For the theater-related campaigns, the breakdown is as follows:

 - Successful campaigns: 839
 - Live campaigns: 24
 - Failed campaigns: 439
 - Canceled campaigns: 37

The theater-related subcategories included plays, musicals and spaces (i.e. theater building projects). Plays represented approxiamtely 77% of the subcategory dataset at 1033 campaigns, with spaces having slightly more campaigns (187) than musicals (140).

## Findings
Analysis of the success rate of theater categories show that plays enjoyed a higher campaign success rate than that of their peer subcategories.
